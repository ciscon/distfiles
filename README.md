# nQuake distribution files

This repository contains the files needed by the nQuake client and server setup. The files will automatically sync to the nQuake mirrors every 10 minutes. If a file is missing from this repository but present @ https://nquake.fnu.nu/, download the original file from there, upload it to this repository as-is (so that reverting is easy), and then commit an update to the file with the desired changes. The change will then propagate to all the mirrors.
